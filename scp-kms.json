# This SCP does the following:
# **Deny S3 Bucket Creation Without KMS:
# Prevents creation of S3 buckets without server-side encryption using KMS
# Ensures all new buckets must use KMS encryption

# Deny S3 Bucket Creation With Non-Approved KMS:
# Restricts bucket creation to only use specific KMS keys
# You need to replace the KMS key ARNs with your approved keys

# **Deny S3 Bucket Encryption Changes:
# Prevents changing bucket encryption settings to non-KMS encryption
# Ensures existing buckets can't be changed to use non-KMS encryption

# **Deny S3 Bucket Encryption Changes With Non-Approved KMS:
# Prevents changing bucket encryption to use non-approved KMS keys
# Ensures only approved KMS keys can be used for encryption

# **To use this SCP:
# Replace the following placeholders:
# region: Your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
# account-id: Your AWS account ID
# your-kms-key-id-1, your-kms-key-id-2: Your approved KMS key IDs
# You can add more KMS key ARNs to the list if needed
# Attach this SCP to your AWS Organizations organizational unit (OU) or account

# Important notes:
# This SCP will affect all accounts in the OU or organization where it's attached
# Make sure to test this in a non-production environment first
# Consider adding exceptions for specific accounts if needed
# The SCP will not affect existing buckets, only new bucket creation and encryption changes
# You might want to add additional conditions based on your specific requirements
